# ASP.NET Core Project Rules

- Use C# 12 language features where appropriate
- Follow SOLID principles in class and interface design
- Implement dependency injection for loose coupling
- Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
- Prefer record types for immutable data structures
- Prefer controller endpoints over minimal APIs
- Implement proper exception handling and logging
- Use strongly-typed configuration with IOptions pattern
- Implement proper authentication and authorization using Keycloak
- Use Entity Framework Core for database operations
- Implement proper versioning for APIs
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use secure communication with HTTPS
- Implement proper model validation
- Use OpenAPI for API documentation
- Implement proper logging with structured logging
- Use background services for long-running tasks
- Favor explicit typing (this is very important). Only use var when evident.
- Make types internal and sealed by default unless otherwise specified
- Prefer Ulid-s for identifiers unless otherwise specified
- Use `is null` checks instead of `== null`. The same goes for `is not null` and `!= null`.
- Use proper naming conventions for variables, methods, classes, etc
- Use proper naming conventions for boolean variables and methods add `Is`, "is" or "has" prefix
- Use `_` as a prefix for private fields
- Don't use `this` keyword in methods unless it's necessary
- Don't use comments only summary comments
- Use summary comments for each class and method keep them short and concise don't use jargon words, also use them for record properties
- Use `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull` to throw an exception if the argument is null
- Use Domain driven design principles
- Use `Result` type for return values from methods of FluentResult
- Use files named `*ErrorCodes.cs` for error codes that are used in the application when returning `Result` from methods of FluentResult
- Check if the error code is already defined in the file `*ErrorCodes.cs` before adding a new one
- Do not use new error codes without adding them to the file `*ErrorCodes.cs`
